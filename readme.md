<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

As this is a wordpress plugin this project requires wordpress to run.

(OPTIONAL) If you wish to modify the Javascript source files and/or PHP dependancies within this project, then you would also need to nave Node, NPM, and Composer installed.

### WordPress Setup Guide

1. Create a [Ticket Spot](https://app.ticketspot.io) - Takes 30 seconds to create one!
2. Create a wordpress site.
3. Use the generated shortcode into your block or within the editor

### Building From Source

1. Go to your wordpress plugin folder

```sh
cd htdocs/wp-contents/plugins
```

2. Download or clone this repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ticket-Spot/wordpress-app
```

3. Open up wordpress and configure the plugin (refer to above)
4. (Optional) Editing javascript. Edit stuff in srcjs and don't edit javascript in includes (its minified and generated from files in srcjs anyway). You'll need nodejs to run though.
5. (Optional) Build your own javascript files

```sh
npm i
npm run develop
```
